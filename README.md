# TPTRS-MQTT

[TPTRS-MQTT](https://github.com/NaoCoding/TPTRS-MQTT) is a project written with **PyQt5** and **MQTT** server, <br> the final project of [Data Science &amp; Communication 2024](https://web.ntnu.edu.tw/~cw/icoil/) NTNU. <br><br>
The default setting of the MQTT broker located at **NTNU**(National Taiwan Normal University), <br>however we can't assume that the MQTT broker will keep working after the course ended.<br>
<br> To run the server with your own MQTT broker, edit the IP address in **server.py** and **client_mqtt.py**.
